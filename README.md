# devops-cli-assistant
DevOps-CLI-Assistant is a command line tool written in Python that uses the AWS CLI to execute AWS commands. It provides simple operations for Docker, Linux, AWS, and Hadoop.

The tool is designed to help developers and DevOps engineers with cloud operations. It can be used to build, run, and manage Docker containers; manage Linux systems; work with AWS services; and use Hadoop.  
The tool is easy to use. To get started, you will need Python installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can simply execute the tool as a Python program:

`python cli_assistant.py`

This will display a list of all the available commands.


### Safety Guidelines  
* The tool is just a Python program, so it does not need any special permissions to run.
* However, it is important to note that the tool can execute AWS commands, which can have security implications. Therefore, it is important to use the tool responsibly and to only execute commands that you trust.
